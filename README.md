## Overview of the Basic Calculator Project

The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will prompt the user to input two numbers and select the desired operation. Based on the user’s choice, the program will perform the selected operation and display the result.

## Project Structure
Function Definitions:

Define individual functions for each arithmetic operation.
Each function takes two numerical inputs and returns the result of the operation.
User Input:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Validate the input to ensure the entered values are numeric.
Operation Selection:

Display a menu of available operations.
Prompt the user to select an operation.
Validate the input to ensure the user selects a valid operation.
Perform Operation:

Based on the user’s selection, call the corresponding function.
Handle division by zero appropriately.
Display Result:

Print the result of the selected operation.
