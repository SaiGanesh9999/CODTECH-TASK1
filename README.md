## Overview of the Basic Calculator Project
The basic calculator project aims to create a command-line application in Python that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user will be prompted to input two numbers and select an operation, after which the program will compute and display the result. This project is a foundational exercise in Python programming, focusing on user input, basic arithmetic, and control structures.

## Key Activities
Defining Arithmetic Functions:
Create functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Input Handling:
Prompt the user to input two numbers.
Validate the input to ensure it is numeric.
Operation Selection:
Display a menu of operations.
Prompt the user to select an operation.
Validate the operation selection.
Performing Calculations:
Execute the selected arithmetic function with the provided numbers.
Handle special cases such as division by zero.
Displaying Results:
Output the result of the calculation to the user.
## Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to implement the calculator.
Built-in functions: input(), print(), float()
Control structures: if, while, try-except
Functions for arithmetic operations
## Key Insights
**User Input Validation:**
Ensuring robust input validation is crucial for creating a reliable program. Handling non-numeric input gracefully prevents runtime errors.
**Modular Code Design:**
Breaking down the program into smaller functions (addition, subtraction, etc.) enhances readability, maintainability, and reusability of the code.
## Error Handling:
Implementing error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs improves the user experience by providing clear feedback and preventing crashes.
## User Interaction:
Providing a clear and simple user interface via the command line ensures the program is user-friendly, even for those with minimal technical skills.
## Summary
This basic calculator project serves as an excellent introduction to fundamental programming concepts in Python. By working on this project, one can gain hands-on experience with functions, user input handling, error management, and control structures, laying a solid foundation for more complex programming tasks.
